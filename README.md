## :rocket: About the MonoRepo

This is a `"MonoRepo"`, to _store all the challenges of the Rocktseat bootcamp_.

_The important thing to keep in mind is the following:_

Rocketseat has an automated testing system, because of this the challenges were created by structuring files according to their request.

_But don't worry, I have knowledge of best practices like_ (`DRY`) _and others, this is possible to see in other projects in my repository._
